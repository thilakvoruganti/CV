# Template Library

Drop at least ten cropped object exemplars in this folder (PNG/JPG/WebP, ideally captured from different scenes) to power Module 2’s library detection demo. Files in nested subfolders are also picked up automatically. The FastAPI endpoint `/api/object/library_detect` scans this directory at runtime, so you can update the templates without redeploying the backend.***
